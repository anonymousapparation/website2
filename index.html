        <p>What you have read is all the general public knows about the ordeal. However, Shaub is more than a concert violinist. He has membership in secret societies, mainly due to his parent's connections. These societies are known to engage in treasure hunting activity and have shown interest in Indian burial mounds in East Tennessee. Shaub was searching for something - along with many others. After years of work, everything culminated last night somewhere around your property. I need you to investigate and follow any clues until you reach a dead end. Once you've done this, see if you can reconstruct the details of what happened.  </p>
